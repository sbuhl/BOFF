<h3 id="technicalspecification:">Technical specification :</h3>

<p>(explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they&#8217;re basic)</p>

<p>BT Agency choose to use the Bootstrap technology to make the website. The main reason is the speed of creation. Indeed, thanks to Bootstrap, it&#8217;s really fast to build a nice website with the use of the classes from this tool.
The responsiveness of the website is &#8220;out of the box&#8221; and it&#8217;s think for the mobile first.
This version of Bootstrap, V4, is using the new technologies &#8220;Flexbox&#8221;, so it&#8217;s even more easy to play with the position of the elements on your grid.
To adapt this website to our needs, we only needed to create 215 personnal lines of CSS. It&#8217;s really few.</p>
